# Dap-Planner-Homework

## About the project.
* As a web developer, I am always going from one meeting to the other: from meeting with potential clients to meeting with fellow developers. I created this app so I can optimize my time management and not lose track of what I have to do at a given time of the day.

I also color coded the time-blocks such that the time block for a particular task would change to red when the time set for the task to be carried out is reached, and the future task stays green.

    I started out by sketching my intended design on a notepad and adding all the major components, classes, id's and the correct tags to use.

    I completed the interactive part with Jquerry and moment.js
